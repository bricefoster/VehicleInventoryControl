# VehicleInventoryControl
Coder Camps October Group 2015 Team Project- Our design intends to be a cost-efficient replacement for the Texas Department of State Health Services current paper based vehicle inventory control system. Admins may register drivers, update vehicle inventory, track vehicle “check in” reports, and override any vehicle reservations. Drivers may reserve vehicles for specific dates and submit “check in” reports. AngularJS as our front-end framework; and ASP.NET C# Web API as our back-end framework with Entity Framework talking to our SQL database.
